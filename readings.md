## Current schedule of readings

This list is subject to change, and it is neither sound (i.e., if something's listed here, that doesn't mean we'll read it) nor complete (i.e., if something's *not* listed here, that doesn't mean we *won't* read it).

Links in the "Topic" column for the first three weeks of class link to lecture notes for those topics.  After that, we'll dispense with the lecture format and move to student presentations.

## Further reading

### The first three weeks

We'll mostly assume that you are familiar with the basics of **propositional logic**, but if you need a refresher, look at [Chapter 1 (Propositional Logic) of _The Calculus of Computation: Decision Procedures with Applications to Verification_ (2007)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74113-8_1) by Aaron R. Bradley and Zohar Manna ([off-campus access link](https://link-springer-com.oca.ucsc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74113-8_1)).  Bradley and Manna's book is also a good alternative resource for many of the other topics covered in Kroening and Strichman.

The [_Handbook of Satisfiability_ (2009)](https://www.iospress.nl/book/handbook-of-satisfiability/) [(off-campus access link to online edition)](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=448770), edited by A. Biere, M. Heule, H. van Maaren, and T. Walsh, is an excellent reference for many topics we'll be covering in the first three weeks of class.

A couple of slightly older CACM articles, in addition to the one we have as an assigned reading, provide an approachable overview of SAT and SMT:

  - Sharad Malik and Lintao Zhang, [Boolean satisfiability: from theoretical hardness to practical success (CACM 2009)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1536637)
  - Leonardo de Moura and Nikolaj Bjørner, [Satisfiability modulo theories: introduction and applications (CACM 2011)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1995394) ([off-campus access link](https://dl-acm-org.oca.ucsc.edu/citation.cfm?doid=1995376.1995394))

Many solver-aided languages and systems rely on the Z3 SMT solver.  The standard citation is: Leonardo de Moura and Nikolaj Bjørner, [Z3: an efficient SMT solver (TACAS 2008)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24) ([off-campus access link](https://link-springer-com.oca.ucsc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24)).  If you want to become familiar with Z3, check out the [tutorial](http://theory.stanford.edu/~nikolaj/programmingz3.html) and [interactive guide](https://rise4fun.com/Z3/tutorial/guide).

Are you bored of academic papers about SMT?  Dennis Yurichev's [SAT/SMT by Example](https://yurichev.com/writings/SAT_SMT_by_example.pdf) is impressive and fun.

### The rest of the course

There's a vast amount of reading material that would be in scope for a course on SMT solving and solver-aided systems, but that this particular course won't have time to cover, including but not limited to:

  - ...material on answer set programming systems with integrated solvers, such as:
    - Martin Gebser et al., [Potassco: the Potsdam answer set solving collection (_AI Communications_, 2011)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1971623) ([off-campus access link](https://web-b-ebscohost-com.oca.ucsc.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=4bf38049-468d-4ddd-840e-4795b3e5829a%40pdc-v-sessmgr01)) (see also: [the Potassco website](https://potassco.org/))
