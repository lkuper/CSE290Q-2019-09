## Further reading

### The first three weeks

We'll mostly assume that you are familiar with the basics of **propositional logic**, but if you need a refresher, look at [Chapter 1 (Propositional Logic) of _The Calculus of Computation: Decision Procedures with Applications to Verification_ (2007)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74113-8_1) by Aaron R. Bradley and Zohar Manna ([off-campus access link](https://link-springer-com.oca.ucsc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74113-8_1)).  Bradley and Manna's book is also a good alternative resource for many of the other topics covered in Kroening and Strichman.

The [_Handbook of Satisfiability_ (2009)](https://www.iospress.nl/book/handbook-of-satisfiability/) [(off-campus access link to online edition)](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=448770), edited by A. Biere, M. Heule, H. van Maaren, and T. Walsh, is an excellent reference for many topics we'll be covering in the first three weeks of class.

A couple of slightly older CACM articles, in addition to the one we have as an assigned reading, provide an approachable overview of SAT and SMT:

  - Sharad Malik and Lintao Zhang, [Boolean satisfiability: from theoretical hardness to practical success (CACM 2009)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1536637)
  - Leonardo de Moura and Nikolaj Bjørner, [Satisfiability modulo theories: introduction and applications (CACM 2011)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1995394) ([off-campus access link](https://dl-acm-org.oca.ucsc.edu/citation.cfm?doid=1995376.1995394))

Many of the solver-aided languages and tools we use rely on the Z3 SMT solver.  The standard citation is: Leonardo de Moura and Nikolaj Bjørner, [Z3: an efficient SMT solver (TACAS 2008)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24) ([off-campus access link](https://link-springer-com.oca.ucsc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24)).  If you want to understand Z3, I suggest working through the [tutorial](https://rise4fun.com/Z3/tutorial/guide).

Are you bored of academic papers about SMT?  Dennis Yurichev's [SAT/SMT by Example](https://yurichev.com/writings/SAT_SMT_by_example.pdf) is impressive and fun.

### The rest of the course

There's a vast amount of reading material that would be in scope for a course on SMT solving and solver-aided systems, but that this particular course won't have time to cover, including but not limited to:

  - ...material on answer set programming systems with integrated solvers, such as:
    - Martin Gebser et al., [Potassco: the Potsdam answer set solving collection (_AI Communications_, 2011)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1971623) ([off-campus access link](https://web-b-ebscohost-com.oca.ucsc.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=4bf38049-468d-4ddd-840e-4795b3e5829a%40pdc-v-sessmgr01)) (see also: [the Potassco website](https://potassco.org/))

  - ...more work on solver design and implementation, such as:
    - 
    - Robert Brummayer and Armin Biere, [Boolector: an efficient SMT solver for bit-vectors and arrays (TACAS 2009)](http://fmv.jku.at/papers/BrummayerBiere-TACAS09.pdf) (see also: [many related publications from the Boolector team](https://boolector.github.io/publications.html))
  - ...more work on solver-aided systems for ensuring consistency in distributed systems, such as:
    - Farzin Houshman and Mohsen Lesani, [Hamsaz: replication coordination analysis and synthesis (POPL 2019)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3302515.3290387)
  - solver-aided systems for bug-finding and fault injection, such as:
    - Peter Alvaro, Joshua Rosen, and Joseph M. Hellerstein, [Lineage-driven fault injection (SIGMOD 2015)](https://people.ucsc.edu/~palvaro/molly.pdf)
  - ...follow-up work on Reluplex, such as:
    - Guy Katz et al., [The Marabou framework for verification and analysis of deep neural networks (CAV 2019)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-25540-4_26.pdf)
  - ...recent creative applications of SMT solvers across subfields of CS, such as:
      - Emma Tosch et al., [PlanAlyzer: assessing threats to the validity of online experiments (OOPSLA 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13649)
      - Gabrielle Beck, Maximilian Zinkus, and Matthew Green, [Using SMT solvers to automate chosen ciphertext attacks (2019)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/958)
  - Etc., etc., etc.
